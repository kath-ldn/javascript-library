# Library Project

## About

This is a simple application to keep track of books that you're reading, have read or plan to read. I developed this for [The Odin Project Javascript Course, Project: Library](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/library). The purpose of this was to practice using constructors - firstly a plain object constructor then a class constructor. It also allowed me to practise JS foundations - functions, for loops, DOM manipulation etc. It uses local storage to store data - this would not be reliable enough for real-life use, but is fine for the purpose of this learning exercise.

## Roadmap

None planned - learning exercise.

### Known Issues

* Bootstrap tooltips are slow to load;
* Add 'are you sure' popup for delete to avoid accidental deletions;
* No way to sort (e.g. by 'read'/'not read');
* Local storage is not reliable (e.g. on my browser if I refresh twice in a row, it clears the cache).
